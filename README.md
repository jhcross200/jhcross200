Hi, im jhcross200,   I want to learn to make rather basic drawings mostly of ships hold spaces and the stowage patterns I come up with to stow the cargo(pulp, aluminum, lumber) .    I often make pencil drawings to guide the stevedores in implementing my stowage patterns.
I want to be more professional about it.   

Thanks
